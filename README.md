# primes from module primePy
This module contains several useful functions to work with prime numbers. For example, extracting all the prime factors (with multiplicity) of a positive integer reasonably fast. Following the list of all functions and their running time.

## Getting started
Download the file primes.py and place it in the same directory where your python is installed. Or, simply run the command 
```
>>>pip install primePy
```
to install the package. After either of the above two methods you can call it by 
```
>>>from primePy import primes
```
 and then execute the available methods.

## Available methods
You may run `primes.about()` after importing the package. The following is a list of all included methods.


`primes.check(n)` returns *True* if *n* is a prime number.<br />
`primes.factor(n)` returns the lowest prime factor of *n*. <br />
`primes.factors(n)` returns all the prime factors of *n* with multiplicity.<br />
`primes.first(n)` returns first *n* many primes. <br />
`primes.upto(n)` returns all the primes less than or equal to *n*. <br />
`primes.between(m,n)` returns all the primes between *m* and *n*. <br />
`primes.phi(n)` returns the Euler's *phi(n)* i.e., the number of integers less than *n* which have no common factor with *n*. <br />


## Demonstration

This program is tested on my personal laptop with the following configurations.

>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4030U CPU @ 1.90Ghz<br/>
>Installed memory(RAM): 6.00GB <br/>
>System type: 64 bit Operating System, x64-based processor<br/>
>Operating system: Windows 10

### A little bigger numbers

All the following commands returned results in less than *5 secs*.

```
>>> primes.factors(2910046587320501324077792713140104371205630933992706145011)
[239, 701, 709, 1997, 1997, 3889, 5171, 5171, 6983, 10009, 4940867, 45845791, 3731292319]
```

```
>>> primes.first(10000)[9999]
104729
```
The last command returns the 10000th prime.
